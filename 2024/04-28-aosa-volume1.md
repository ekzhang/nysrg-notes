- AOSA, Volume 1 â€” [[April 28th, 2024]]
    - Themes are listed below.
    - Audacity: Plugin systems, performance impedance mismatch between threads / buffers, GUI frameworks, decoupling application logic from systems, data structures.
        - GUI frameworks today are quite different, likely due to the influence of React.
    - Bash: Standardization and backward-compatibility, behavior edge cases, parser considerations, weaker types allowing for a more dynamic language (static and dynamic tension), code being affected by historical changes (Unicode), lack of community dev involvement.
        - Related projects: How does it compare to Powershell? More structured, object-oriented. Perhaps stricter and more cumbersome.
        - Lisp is similarly dynamic, with self-modifying code. But a lot less popular, likely because of the difference in domain. Interactive exploration tends towards dynamic languages.
        - "It's up to the author to just write a readable script."
    - CMake: Unifying two build systems, cross-platform identity versus behavior, portabillity, embedded scripting language for build systems, scope and success/failure of various integrated components (analysis, tests, plugins).
        - Example from Alex: Uses CMake at work, has a common macro system to develop their own DSL for compiling C++ libraries and executables, specifying dependencies.
    - HDFS: Focusing on networking considerations with topology / racks, fault-tolerant replication, control (NameNode) and data separation, daemons to balance utilization and fix corruption, tuning many time/storage/ratio/replication parameters by human operators, "fat client."
        - Someone at group: Used HDFS via a deployment on Kubernetes, and queried the NameNode for file locations so they could colocate jobs on pods that had that data.
    - LLVM: Code reuse for compiler projects (extensibility / cleanness), "peephole" optimization, fully-specified intermediate representations, infrastructure as libraries instead of an app, tests as a first-class language representation, modularity allows replacement and contribution.
        - Mentions MLIR, should we read about it? Look at GPU / FPGA support.

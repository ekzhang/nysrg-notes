- Media codecs — [[January 21st, 2024]]
    - Audio
        - Sequence of very fast "samples"
        - What is a sample? Measuring the __physical movement__ of the speaker over time!
        - Bit rate = amount of data per second
        - VBR = strategy, change bit rate automatically to match quality, so silence has less bits, noise has many bits
            - Relevant for __lossy__ codecs, ~ compression level
        - Why do we need multiple channels?
            - 1 = mono (one channel)
            - 2 = stereo (two ears, headphones) + center?
            - more than 2 = speaker systems? or locations in space?
            - standard is 5.1
            - Dolby Atmos — speaker system can simulate an abstract directional space
            - can also have dubs / translations in channels
        - Latency number? — compression buffer / chunk size based on time / bitrate
        - (32-bit PCM standard in Ableton)
        - Each sample is a integer / floating-point
        - Formats are important! __gapless looping__
        - For most media work (video editing, game dev) — most tools will standardize all audio imports.
    - "Falsehoods about distributed systems that programmers believe"
        - You might meet these in your life
            - Time only goes forward
            - There are 365 days in a year
        - You will not meet this in your life
            - Media is nasty? — let's sacrifice ourselves to learning about this
            - What is video
                - Images through time
                    - What is color
            - What is audio
                - Muxed / demuxed
                - PCM
                - Bitrate
                - Sample rate
            - ~~What is infinity~~
            - Encoding, transcoding
                - Performance in implementation / energy-efficiency
    - Compare different formats
        - AV1 — "hot" format
        - VP8/VP9 — also open-source, possibly related to AV1
        - H.265 vs H.264 — both by the MPEG industry group
    - Licensing and compatibility issues?
        - What software / hardware do you need in order to support a codec
        - Who do you need to pay money to

    - What data are you storing?
        - Enum values (integer values)
        - Floating-point / numeric data
        - Logs? Probably.
            - Indices might look different
            - Storage format?
        - Images and videos, perhaps
            - Links / IDs to external storage
            - String "vi-123456-on-january-23.mov"
    - **Defined in terms of the __access pattern__ over the data.**
        - OLAP
        - Looking at data in the past, not necessarily by recently
        - Lots of data
        - Don't need 1ms latency, maybe 100ms, 1s, 5s, 10s, …?
    - Prometheus:
        - System for scraping, storing, and backing up metrics
        - Make queries via a web UI, and install special query "rules" that trigger alerts (email, text message)
